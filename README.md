# auto-release-qms


Once you commit your code with message convention, for example, feat: add some features, it will trigger the semantic-release. Default convention message with angular preset included:

**fix -> bug fixes: patch release**

**feat -> feature: minor release**

**breaking change -> break change: major release**

1. Once you push your code it will run GitHub Action and release your project.

2. Then it will create Release and CHANGELOG.md in the project.
